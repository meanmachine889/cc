  ```typescript
  const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Mainnet; // Change from Devnet
  ```

### Wallet Connection Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet" button
2. Wallet modal appears with options
3. User selects wallet and approves
4. Connected state shows truncated wallet address
5. User can access all protected pages

---

## 📊 Mock Data vs Real Data

### Currently Mock (for MVP demo):
- ✅ Dashboard statistics
- ✅ Auction price decreases
- ✅ Marketplace order book
- ✅ Recent trades
- ✅ User balances

### Ready for Integration:
- Database models are complete
- API endpoints can be added
- Smart contract calls can replace mock functions
- Real-time price updates can be implemented

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Expected in MVP)

1. **No Real Blockchain Transactions**
   - All transactions are simulated
   - Toast notifications instead of actual txs
   - Connect real smart contracts in Phase 2

2. **Mock Data**
   - Dashboard shows static mock data
   - Auction prices don't actually decrease
   - Order book is simulated

3. **No User Persistence**
   - Industry profiles not saved to DB yet
   - No session management
   - Wallet address used as identifier

4. **Document Upload**
   - UI only, no actual file storage
   - Implement S3/IPFS in Phase 2

---

Build completed successfully:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Only minor ESLint warnings (unused vars)
- ✅ All pages optimized
- ✅ Static generation where possible
- ✅ Bundle size: ~102KB shared chunks

---

---

## 📝 Environment Variables Needed

Create a `.env` file:
```env
# Database (for production)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/carbononchain"

# SMTP (for waitlist emails)
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-app-password"

# Future: Add when implementing
# OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
```

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database Schema**
   - Schema is updated but not pushed
   - Run `npx prisma db push` when DATABASE_URL is set
   - Current waitlist functionality still works

2. **Wallet Adapter CSS**
   - CSS is imported in SolanaWalletProvider
   - Styles may need theme customization
   - Check `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css`

3. **Deployment**
   - Application is ready for Vercel deployment
   - Ensure env vars are set in deployment platform
   - Database must be accessible from deployment

4. **SEO**
   - Existing landing page SEO preserved
   - New pages need metadata (optional)
   - Add to sitemap for production
